# Data clustering using Single Linkage Agglomerative Clusting

This project contains a custom implementation of library function. The focus of implementation was to produce accurate results. As this is a first implementation, performance optimizations are not considered. 

Using this function implementation, a small data is visualized as cluster and compared the output against standard library function. 

### Data

Data used here is part class material provided by faculty.
